## Installation

  npm i

## Usage

  The user needs to know that if they would like the license badge, this is still being worked on to provide the actual image of the badge. Until this is fixed within the code, the user should review the final README project before committing any changes.

## Contributing

  It’s a simple application to assist for a README file. The best way to contribute to the repo would be to determine if any additional questions should be included along with the image badge for the project.

# Tests

  npm
