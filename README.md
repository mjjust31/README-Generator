  ## Recording: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ovez8Mw9BsfgM4cYwxO_eJMpVmbDlxwC/view
  

  ## Description
  Guides the user by answering questions prompts to create a README document for the user’s project. It takes the prompts by following best practices from https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide. The user will answer a series of questions about their project. After answering all the questions, the application will generate a README file for their application.
  
  ## Installation
  npm i

  ## Usage
  The user needs to know that if they would like the license badge, this is still being worked on to provide the actual image of the badge. Until this is fixed within the code, the user should review the final README project before committing any changes. 
  
  ## Contributing
  It’s a simple application to assist for a README file. The best way to contribute to the repo would be to determine if any additional questions should be included along with the image badge for the project.
  
  ## Tests
  npm
